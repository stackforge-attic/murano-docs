            <title>Project Background</title>
            <para>Enterprise customers frequently use Windows-based environments for their internal and external
                products. Configuration of the Windows environment is a complex task which usually requires a lot of
                effort from administrators. Windows setup consists of numerous services which might be tightly coupled
                to each other. While the automated installation of Windows services can be fairly straightforward,
                service configuration can be hard to automate because it requires a well-designed Windows architecture
                and deep knowledge of Windows services configuration.
            </para>
            <para>Currently several open source solutions exists that can help to partially solve automation of Windows
                environment provisioning. In the world of OpenStack there is the Heat project, which is similar to
                Amazon Cloud Formation. Heat is an excellent tool for managing OpenStack cloud resources such as VM
                instances, security groups, and so on. It allows you to define all cloud resources in a single JSON
                template, then later maintain all of those resources by editing that template. Although the declarative
                template approach is well suited to OpenStack resources, it quickly becomes complex when it comes to
                application management.
            </para>
            <para>Another option is a tool such as Chef or Puppet. These tools are flexible, but require you to have a
                deep knowledge of scripting and require a significant amount of effort to manually script or modify
                cookbooks for your specific environment configuration. This is manageable in a stable environment, but
                it becomes time-consuming and involves manual script coding when one needs to deploy various
                environments with rapidly changing configurations. Also Chef and Puppet require additional
                infrastructure to support them.
            </para>
            <para>The biggest problem for both approaches above is in supporting multi-step configuration of services
                with circular dependencies required for correct configuration of Windows services. This can be solved by
                using external orchestration.
            </para>
            <para>Another potential problem is the lack of UI functionality enabling creation and configuration of an
                environment without writing a script.
            </para>
            <section>
                <title>Proposal</title>
                <para>Mirantis proposes to introduce a new service which will allow a non-experienced user to deploy
                    reliable Windows based environments in a “push-the-button” manner. The key goal is to provide a UI
                    and API enabling the deployment and operation of Windows Environments at the Windows Services
                    abstraction level. The service should be able to orchestrate complex circular dependent cases in
                    order to set up a complex Windows Environment with multiple dependant services.
                </para>
                <para>The service will address following use cases:
                    <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
                        <listitem>

                        </listitem>
                    </itemizedlist>
                </para>
                <para>
                    The solution will provide higher level of abstraction for manipulation Windows Environments. Key
                    concepts are:

            <para>Murano Service API is a programmatic interface used for
                interaction
                with Murano. Other interaction
                mechanisms like Murano Dashboard or Murano CLI should use API
                as underlying
                protocol for interaction.
