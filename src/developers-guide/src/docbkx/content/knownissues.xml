                Due to current Heat limitation services that involve
                load-balancer creation (farms) can be deployed only by tenant administrators.

                When Heat creates different clients for Nova, Cinder and others
                it doesn't pass SSL-related options to clients' constructor.
                If Nova is configured to have SSL endpoints and self-signed
                certificates Heat will fail to create instances because there
                is no way to disable server certificate validation as there is
                no "insecure" flag passed etc.

                Farm services can't be deployed without KeyPair. If KeyPair is not set
                load balancer won't be created and these messages will show up in logs:
