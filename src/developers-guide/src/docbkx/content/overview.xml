    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>Welcome to Murano Project.
        Murano is intended to get opportunity for non-experienced
        users to deploy reliable Windows-based environments with 1-Click.
        Key goal is to provide UI and API which
        allows to deploy and operate Windows environments on the "Windows
        Services" abstraction level. The Service should be able to orchestrate
        complex circular dependent cases in order to setup complete Windows
        environments with many dependant services.
